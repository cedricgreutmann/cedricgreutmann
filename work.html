					<div class="projectAbout"><h4>About</h4><br><p>A project created in my MSc Design and Digital Media program at University of Edinburgh. The main aim here was gaining familiarity with dynamic pages. Creating databases and making websites display information from said database. Additionally as extra credit we also integrated a user account system with logins, profile pictures. This feature was to be expanded, but was not completed due to lack of time.
					</BR></BR>This was done through PHP and MySQL. For the design of the site Bootstrap framework was used, allowing for responsive design workflow.</p>

					The work consisted of a main company page, I also created a specific page for their newest production Chronos. For specific info about the series and particularly info on the premiere of the web series. Alongside this I developed a poster for the premiere of the series on Campus.
					<br><br>
					The site was more of a static page, meant to give information to visitors about the company, the members and their newest project Chronos. In addition to the web presence I also helped in creating a poster for the premiere of the show Chronos.</p>

					<div class="projectTitle"><h4>Historic Lens: Edinburgh VR</h4>
					</div>
					<div class="projectAbout"><h4>About</h4><br><p>In this project I wanted to create a VR experience. I recreated a historic map of Edinburgh in 3D space that can be explored with a Vive VR headset. Its main feature is that it shows how the city has grown through three different time periods. This experience is based off a map found in the National Library archives. The map consisted of a combination of different time period maps, with color coded streets and buildings to show when certain areas were built.
					<br><br>
					I used this map and traced abstract 3D models off of it. To create the basic layout of the city. To add to the map I then created more detailed models of certain more iconic buildings, which in VR, can be picked up using the vive controllers and investigated closer.
					<br><br>
					The 3D assets were created in Maya 2016, and textured in Substance Painter. I finally took the models and programmed all the VR experience in the Unity game engine.</p>

					<div class="projectTitle"><h4>Starfish Novel - Beebe Station</h4>
					</div>
					<div class="projectAbout"><h4>About</h4><br><p>In this project we were asked to build a under water station described in the Novel <i>Starfish</i> (2000) by Peter Watts. Based off of this we then created a 3D base in the unity engine that was explorable. Modeling the pieces of the base in Maya and texturing them. The group also created individual assets but, were for the second part allowed to use assets from the whole group with giving credit were due.
					<br><br>
					From the reading I imagined the base to be very small and crammed. Giving the player a bit of a claustraphobic feeling when exploring. The idea behind the project was to only create a 3D space that could be explored. However while desiging the level, I realized I was missing something a gameplay mechanic. So I added a simple mechanic of finding the memory tapes throughout the station. Similar to other games of finding collectables. Once the player had found the tapes could they pass the level and continue on to a potential future level. 
					<br><br> 
					For this project I also worked with a other student in the sound program, to create the sounds the station gives off, as well as the recordings of the voice on the tapes spread across the station.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="projectAbout"><h4>About</h4><br><p>This project was part of completing my Msc in Design and Digital media. In this project I wanted to explore if it was possible to direct players of a video game through environment cues. To do this I created a interior level, in a underground bunker. This maze like tunnel system was supposed to be very confusing and disorientating. Through this level at certain points I had intersections where I purposly placed one of a few environmental cues. These were meant to either direct a player down the correct path, or deter them the players from the incorrect paths to the correct one. Once I had this level built I had players test the level to see what out of the cues I placed into the level actually work and which did not.
						<br><br>
					Overall the experience was very interesting as it was interesting to see the influence the different envirornmtal cues had on the players. Especially when looking at the background of the players with previous experiences with games and if that influenced them.</p>

					<div class="projectTitle"><h4>Concept Currency</h4>
					</div>
					<div class="projectAbout"><h4>About</h4><br><p>Here I was creating a new design concept for a future world, layed out in a design brief, that had been flooded by effects of global warming. This fictional currency named the: Regulated Dollar, would be the world wide currency. Therefore the design and concept of the currency had to appeal to the world population.
					<br><br>
					These designs included notes for 50, 100, 500 and 1000. With each of the notes representing a theme. For example the 50, was to represent world peace. Since countries in this fictional world had to overcome this flooding together they now would have to stick together as one. The other notes represent renewable energy, Asian world wonders, and finally European world wonders. The historical buildings notes, so the last two, were supposed to represent potentially lost monumental buildings after the flooding. 
					<br><br>
					These notes were mainly created with Photoshop, using images and fractals gathered from the web, then blended together. The symbols were created in Illustrator.</p>
