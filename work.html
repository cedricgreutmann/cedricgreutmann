					<div class="projectAbout"><h4>About</h4><br><p>A project created in my MSc Design and Digital Media program at University of Edinburgh. The main aim here was gaining familiarity with dynamic pages. Creating databases and making websites display information from said database. Additionally as extra credit we also integrated a user account system with logins, profile pictures. This feature was to be expanded, but was not completed due to lack of time.
					</BR></BR>This was done through PHP and MySQL. For the design of the site Bootstrap framework was used, allowing for responsive design workflow.</p>

					<br><br>
					The work consisted of a main company page, I also created a specific page for their newest production Chronos. For specific info about the series and particularly info on the premiere of the web series. Alongside this I developed a poster for the premiere of the series on Campus.
					<br><br>
					The site was more of a static page, meant to give information to visitors about the company, the members and their newest project Chronos.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="projectAbout"><h4>About</h4><br><p>In this project I wanted to explore and create a VR experience. I recreated a historic map of Edinburgh in 3D space that can be explored with a VR headset. Its main feature is that it shows how the city has grown through three different time periods. This experience is based off a map found in the National Library archives. The map consisted is a combination of different time period maps, with color coded streets and buildings to show when certain areas were built.
					<br><br>
					I used this map and traced abstract 3D models off of it. To create the basic layout of the city. To add to the map I then created more detailed models of certain most iconic buildings, which, in VR, can be picked up and investigated closer.
					<br><br>
					The 3D assets were created in Maya 2016, and textured in Substance Painter. I finally took the models and programmed all the VR experience in the Unity game engine.</p>

					<div class="projectTitle"><h4>Concept Currency</h4>
					</div>
					<div class="projectAbout"><h4>About</h4><br><p>Here I was creating a new design concept for a future world, layed out in a design brief, that had been flooded by effects of global warming. This fictional currency named the: Regulated Dollar, would be the world wide currency. Therefore the design and concept of the currency had to appeal to the world population.
					<br><br>
					These designs included notes for 50, 100, 500 and 1000. With each of the notes representing a theme. For example the 50, was to represent world peace. Since countries in this fictional world had to overcome this flooding together they now would have to stick together as one. The other notes represent renewable energy, Asian world wonders, and finally European world wonders. The historical buildings notes, so the last two, were supposed to represent potentially lost monumental buildings after the flooding. 
					<br><br>
					These notes were mainly created with Photoshop, using images and fractals gathered from the web, then blended together. The symbols were created in Illustrator.</p>
